#Virtual Tourist

This is an app that downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app will allow users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

##How is it made?

This app uses Core Data to store its data. Core Data is an object graph and persistence framework provided by Apple in the Mac OS X and iOS operating systems. The app uses a schema called a managed object model â€” an instance of NSManagedObjectModel. When you start a new project in Xcode and open the template selection dialog, select the Use Core Data checkbox. A source file for the Core Data model is created as part of the template. That source file will have the extension .xcdatamodeld. Select that file in the navigator area to display the Core Data model editor. Then you create an entiry and assign attributes to it. 


##How to use it?

Just download the app on your phone and start using it.
